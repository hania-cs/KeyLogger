# C# Keylogger

This is a simple keylogger developed for a university cybersecurity course. The keylogger is written in C# and captures keystrokes from the keyboard, recording them in a log file for further analysis. 

## Features

- Records keystrokes from the keyboard.
- Stores the captured keystrokes in a log file.
- Runs in the background without user interaction.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the solution file in Visual Studio.
3. Build the project.
4. Run the compiled executable (`Keylogger.exe`).
5. The keylogger will start capturing keystrokes silently in the background.
6. To stop the keylogger, terminate the process manually from the Task Manager.

## Research Paper

For detailed information about the design, implementation, and security implications of this keylogger, please refer to the attached research paper titled "Keylogger" (file name: `Keylogger.pdf`). This research paper was fully authored by me, Hania Seifeldeen, and provides comprehensive insights into keylogging techniques and countermeasures in cybersecurity, including steps for hiding the executable file of the keylogger inside a JPEG.
